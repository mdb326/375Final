# CSE375 Final Project

## Project Title
**Study on Energy Aware Locking**

## Team Members
- Ryan Cleary
- Matthew Bergin 

## Course Information
- **Course:** CSE375 - Principle & Practice of Parallel Computing 
- **Instructor:** Prof. Roberto Palmieri 
- **Semester:** Spring 2025

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights on the relationship between energy consumption and performance in parallel executions utilizing locks. The goal is to find an optimal method of processing workloads of varying complexities by distrubuting locked threads on cores to reduce the power consumption of the machines executing the program.
